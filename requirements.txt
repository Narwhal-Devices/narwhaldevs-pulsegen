Requires: Python 3.xx and packages imported in comms.py

Currently works on Windows and Linux.

Macintosh Virtual Comport (VCP) drivers support a maximum baud rate of 115200, which
is below the firmware fixed Pulse Generator baud rate of 12000000.

The Pulse Generator baud rate can be reduced to 115200 with a firmware change. Doing so
reduced the communication speed with the computer, but otherwise does not affect device
performance in any way.
